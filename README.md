This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors. Modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer obtained using `as_mut_ptr()` can cause unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer alternative using proper vector manipulation techniques.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and safe Rust programming practices.
